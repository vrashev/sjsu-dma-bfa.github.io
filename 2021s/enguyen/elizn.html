  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>"As adults, we tend to reminisce about our childhoods—a time where we felt joyful and enthusiastic over the simple things. We think back to all the good times we had with our friends and family and recall moments of excitement gained from exploring new experiences. I have always coupled the idea of childhood innocence with these moments of amusement and bliss—memories where you can look back and appreciate the simplicity during that time. And, to some degree, this sort of youthful ignorance inherently guides the hopefulness and optimism of a child. However, I was never given that chance to be a kid—to be childish and immature and to take joy in the simpler things. It is unfortunate, as I didn’t feel safe at home nor did I feel safe at school.

On account of this, (insert title) is a 3D environment that holds a series of continuous rooms that are intended to represent these traumatic moments of my childhood that I think about often. The digital illustrations, either UV mapped or directly imported, are presented in the world in a child-like perspective. The environment is made to have my viewers walk through these moments and to have them not only witness the world I came from, but to learn where I stand today. As an adult, I’ve been able to experience that carefree feeling that I longed for as a child. I appreciate the simple things that I have now, and I’ve learned that it’s okay to show your emotions and to speak up. All I wanted was to be heard and as a result, I have my art to tell my story."</p>

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Nguyen is a digital media artist who primarily specializes in digital illustration, web development, 3D modeling, video editing, and electronic interfaces. Her studies at San Jose State University sparked her interest in mixed media art, particularly between virtual 2D and 3D elements. Two of her biggest inspirations are Meggie Johnson, whose illustrations express positivity around mundane objects in vibrant, yet warm colors, and Andry Rasoahaingo (Dedouze), who is a self-taught taught illustrator and 2D/3D animator whose work consists of 2D illustrations displayed in a 3D environment. In the future, Elizabeth plans to develop a long-term series of different 3D isometric environments with 2D illustrated elements blending within the setting, which will be displayed as an archive on Instagram.</p>
