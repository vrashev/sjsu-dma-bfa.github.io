  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>My work includes a hybrid of photography, digital art and illustration work. Since I have experience with such a variety of mediums I consider myself to be a digital media artist. Growing up in a digital revolution has inspired me to investigate how various technologies can be incorporated and/or enhanced into my artwork. As I grew accustomed to the field, my interest has shifted into 3D modeling and design which I intend to pursue after I finish the BFA Digital Media Art program at San Jose State University. I believe in making technology as accessible and easy to understand for everyone through interaction design.</p>
  <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
  <p>Sabrina Chan is a multimedia artist who tends to focus on digital illustration. Through the course of her education at San Jose State University, she has learned a variety of programs such as Blender, Python, JavaScript, After Effects, Fusion 360, and many others. Once Sabrina graduates from the BFA program, she intends to take more courses pertaining to UI and UX design as well as 3d modeling to pursue a career in a field that merges art and technology to make a better experience for users of all media types.</p>
