  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>" I decided on creating my own original character illustrations and models in order to test my own concept creation and originality. What had inspired this project was my interest in anime, video games and VTubers. The central focus for this project in particular are 2d character illustrations alongside 3d modeled characters, in a Pokemon theme. These works fit into the overall flow of my development as an artist, because I aim to go into video game design, specifically in character creation. The central idea of this project is to portray these 3d models alongside their 2d illustrations, and have the 3d models mimic the same movements I make in real time, through face rigging software. The viewers will experience how these models can become more than just regular, still avatars.
