  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>As a digital media artist, I incorporate elements of fantasy and human emotions to tell stories connected to nature and life on planet earth. I convey my inner emotions and signify life teachings, which connect to the beauty of nature and real world ideas. I take elements of what Iâ€™ve seen as a world traveler and incorporate them into new concepts, which bridge a gap between fantasy and reality. My digital paintings, 3D models and installations are inspired by this gap to further expand on my inspirational messages. Travelling around the world and viewing various elements of nature such as mountains, forests, flowers, oceans, and animals have inspired me to create art that depicts the deep connection I have with our planet and life teachings. Through digital media art, I create new virtual environments, which take elements of real world concepts and collide them with fictional, fantasy-like creations. </p>

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<p>"Jessica Prakash is a digital media artist that grew up in San Jose, California. She studies at San Jose State and will be receiving her BFA in May 2021. At San Jose State, she worked with design, video and image editing, photography, 3D modelling, and digital painting. Her work focuses on using elements from nature to create fictional worlds and tell stories connected to her life experiences, travels and family history.

Her ancestors, which were originally from India, were forced to move to Fiji Islands, where they had struggled with hardships, all while keeping their culture alive. After many years, they were all able to build better lives, which is exactly what happened to Jessica, since her parents were from Fiji, and immigrated to America, where Jessica was born and raised. Family history is what allowed her to become more fascinated in travel and nature. As a digital media artist, Jessica uses her life experiences to inspire her messages and stories told within her digital art."</p>
