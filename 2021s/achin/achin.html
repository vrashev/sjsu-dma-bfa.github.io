  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>"This piece presents an assortment of objects with only the prompt: make a sandwich. Picture this: your childhood toy chest is now your refrigerator. Don’t lie, we’ve all put toys in our mouths anyways. Remember what it was like getting that bucket of legos and you had to figure out what to do with it? The goal of this piece is to be a sandbox where people are forced to use their imaginations, to make the viewer question what something would taste like just off of how it looks. 
My cousin and I often walk through the toy section at Target, look around the toy section and say “what the heck are kids doing now?”. Other than toys for toddlers, toys have really just grown up with us. Everything is a collectible now, something you wouldn’t dream of opening and giving to a child. Even lego sets are movie or game tie ins. You can’t put minecraft blocks in your mouth to separate them, the same way you needed to for legos. How are kids going to connect with the experience of the tactile toys of our time? This piece seeks to meet kids on their home playing field, the virtual space, in response to the decline of physical toys.  
This piece is semi autobiographical with my own personal experience. I want the viewers to experience my memory. It's 2hrs since school ended, your parents still haven't picked you up, and now your toys look tasty"</p>

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<p>Aaron Arthur Chin is an interdisciplinary artist obtaining his BFA in digital media art at San Jose State University. He sets his focus on experimenting with 3 dimensional work on the screen and the interplay between digital and physical mediums. The bezel of screens are the modern picture frame. The digital space is unique for the ability to frame sculpture fully in the round. He explores the possibilities only possible in the digital medium. What draws him towards digital work are the vibrant colors only possible on screens, the defiance of physics and the infinite. His main inspirations are artists like Alex Mcleod and Kristof Zetterstrand.</p>
